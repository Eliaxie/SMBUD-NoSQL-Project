{"abstract": "AdaBoost algorithm based on Haar-like features can achieves high accuracy (above 95%) in object detection. Meanwhile massive computing power is needed to implement the cascaded classifiers involved in AdaBoost detection. To solve this problem, several dedicated hardware solutions have been proposed for real-time applications. In this work, a novel heterogeneous architecture of an AdaBoost detector is presented. This architecture achieves higher performance while consuming fewer hardware resources. By combining an integrated ARM Cortex-A9 processor with a dedicated accelerator, this architecture can be configured to realize various objects detection by simply loading different parameters. 2-D parallelism is involved in accelerator unit combination which brings more flexibility. This scheme is implemented on Xilinx ZC702 platform, the experiment result shows that 40 QVGA frames per second can be achieved for real-time face detection. The accelerator achieves more than 13 times improvement over the OpenCV implementation on a standalone Cortex-A9 w.r.t execution speed. Meanwhile, the accelerator consumes 40% less FPGA hardware resources than the prior-art implementation.", "authors": ["Zheng Xu", "Runbin Shi", "Zhihao Sun", "Yaqi Li", "Yuanjia Zhao", "Chenjian Wu"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["0a11984c-ab6e-4b75-9291-e1b700c98d52", "1f4152a3-481f-4adf-a29a-2193a3d4303c", "3c2ddf0a-237b-4d17-8083-c90df5f3514b", "522ce553-29ea-4e0b-9ad3-0ed4eb9de065", "579e5f24-5b13-4e92-b255-0c46d066e306", "5d0b987d-eed9-42ce-9bf3-734d98824f1b", "80656b4d-b24c-4d92-8753-bdb965bcd50a", "d6e37fb1-5f7e-448e-847b-7d1f1271c574"], "title": "A Heterogeneous System for Real-Time Detection with AdaBoost", "venue": "high performance computing and communications", "year": 2016, "id": "001eef4f-1d00-4ae6-8b4f-7e66344bbc6e"}

{"abstract": "This paper studies the problem of using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to seek the source of some signal in the underwater environment. To avoid the redundant travels for getting the local gradient in existing methods, we propose a novel source-seeking strategy in which the AUV keeps updating an estimated field model using measurements along its gradient-climbing path. Based on the convergence results of the sequential least-squares field estimation algorithm and the path planning method by nonlinear programming, the AUV will finally reach a maximum of the field which indicates a potential source. The way-point tracking control of the AUV is realized by a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme embedded with the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed source-seeking strategy is validated in the simulation experiment with a real AUV model.", "authors": ["Xiaodong Ai", "Keyou You", "Shiji Song"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["1862a08a-08c6-4ab1-a214-8932bbd0d2d9", "7bcea2f7-6006-4a4d-8529-3593fa56d2dc", "c1959b6f-8bab-49a2-ae2f-066c43cfc9c9", "d65d26b4-a0e0-4112-ae22-2f3a4b51d7b3", "e66104e4-31fd-43d6-a056-f52bf8ae7eee"], "title": "A source-seeking strategy for an autonomous underwater vehicle via on-line field estimation", "venue": "international conference on control, automation, robotics and vision", "year": 2016, "id": "00352759-f0a7-4678-82ae-fed68c700da6"}

{"abstract": "This paper presents a methodology to analyze linguistic changes in a given textual corpus allowing to overcome two common problems related to corpus linguistics studies. One of these issues is the monotonic increase of the corpus size with time and the other one is the presence of noise in the textual data. In addition, our method allows to better target the linguistic evolution of the corpus, instead of other aspects like noise fluctuation or topics evolution. A corpus formed by two newspapers, \"La Gazette de Lausanne\" and \"Le Journal de Gen\\`eve\", is used, providing 4 million articles from 200 years of archives. We first perform some classical measurements on this corpus in order to provide indicators and visualizations of linguistic evolution. We then define the concept of a lexical kernel and word resilience, to face the two challenges of noises and corpus size fluctuations.

{"abstract": "Boneh and Durfee (Eurocrypt 1999) proposed two polynomial time attacks on small secret exponent RSA. The first attack works when d  0.284  whereas the second attack works when d  0.292 . Both attacks are based on lattice based Coppersmith's method to solve modular equations. Durfee and Nguyen (Asiacrypt 2000) extended the attack to a variant of RSA where prime factors are not the same sizes. However, the attack extended only the first attack of the Boneh-Durfee. Hence, an open problem remains, i.e., if the Boneh-Durfee second attack can be extended to unbalanced RSA. In this paper, we propose a desired attack that extended the Boneh-Durfee second attack. Our proposed attack fully improves the Durfee-Nguyen attack for all size of prime factors. The improvement stems from our technical lattice construction. Although Durfee and Nguyen only analyzed lattices whose basis matrices are triangular, we analyze broader classes of lattices that contain non-triangular basis matrices. The analysis can be performed by using the unravelled linearization proposed by Herrmann and May (Asiacrypt 2009) and the transformation on the Boneh-Durfee lattices proposed by Takayasu and Kunihiro (PKC 2016). As a result, we can exploit useful algebraic structure compared with the Durfee-Nguyen.", "authors": ["Atsushi Takayasu", "Noboru Kunihiro"], "n_citation": 0, "title": "Small secret exponent attacks on RSA with unbalanced prime factors", "venue": "international symposium on information theory and its applications", "year": 2016, "id": "01537b60-9ae2-4684-a1fa-e688e7757e6f"}
{"abstract": "Container identification and recognition is still performed manually or in a semi-automatic fashion in multiple ports globally. This results in errors and inefficiencies in port operations. The problem of automatic container identification and recognition is challenging as the ISO standard only prescribes the pattern of the code and does not specify other parameters such as the foreground and background colors, font type and size, orientation of characters (horizontal or vertical) so on. Additionally, the corrugated surface of container body makes the two dimensional projection of the text on three dimensional containers slanted and jagged. We propose a solution in the form of an end-to-end pipeline that uses Region Proposals generated based on Connected Components for text detection in conjunction with Spatial Transformer Networks for text recognition. We demonstrate via our experimental results that the pipeline is reliable and robust even in situations when the code characters are highly distorted and outperforms the state-of-the-art results for text detection and recognition over the containers.

{"abstract": "Ever-evolving malware continues to flood the Internet at an alarming rate. This makes it challenging for security organizations and anti-malware vendors to devise effective solutions. It is, therefore, imperative to study automated tools and techniques for quick detection of malware, possibly limiting or preventing any impact on the target. The code or behavioural patterns obtained from malware analysis can be used to classify new malware samples into their existing families and recognize those which possess unknown behaviour and thus need a closer manual inspection.

{"abstract": "A network embedding is a representation of a large graph in a low-dimensional space, where vertices are modeled as vectors. The objective of a good embedding is to preserve the proximity between vertices in the original graph. This way, typical search and mining methods can be applied in the embedded space with the help of off-the-shelf multidimensional indexing approaches.

{"abstract": "Metaheuristics, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs), and hyper-heuristics have been widely studied and applied in the literature. This led to the development of several frameworks to aid the execution and development of such algorithms. Consequently, the reusability, scalability and maintainability became fundamental points to be attacked by developers. Such points can be improved using Design Patterns, but despite their advantages, few works have explored their usage with metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics. In order to contribute to this research topic, we present a solution based on the Visitor pattern used to design genetic operators. A case study is presented with the Hyper-heuristic for the Integration and Test Order problem (HITO). This case study shows that the proposed solution can increase the reusability of the implemented operators, and also enable easy addition of new genetic operators and representations.", "authors": ["Giovani Guizzo", "Silvia Regina Vergilio"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["16bc6bb0-748a-4272-ae22-32b5b1538321", "1d111ef9-6b14-4af7-b49b-f1a1a5c0f11a", "43cb5f98-9813-42ff-845b-0171a67943b0", "45913319-0e7c-42e4-8a25-ac2124c373f5", "72508eaa-e394-4e9c-8324-63ffb5a9cd7b", "7480f0fe-f18c-4ae9-b47a-0dc4340f927f", "7decfecd-eed2-4add-8b5d-726e9c50c244", "a74f9944-5d5f-4e70-ae6b-ad90c10b6502", "c4eb7c15-5002-4f0e-969a-56511496e88d", "cd42f327-6765-4767-969e-abfa55d58763", "d326127b-32ca-42f8-8194-856fb5b66fdb", "da25b6b0-9637-4422-9ad7-f766597785dc", "dca57849-52b1-495b-b142-33d1974c90f3", "f273d116-f7c4-486e-ba3c-bbefa620513d", "f7637c3e-5153-4d81-bb9c-dd4f2c8d4118"], "title": "Metaheuristic Design Pattern: Visitor for Genetic Operators", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "id": "04d72bcc-7998-4a8d-8fe9-8ff3dab793a4"}

{"abstract": "Betweenness centrality is a popular metric in social science, and recently it was adopted also in computer science. Betweenness identifies the node, or the nodes, that are most suitable to perform critical network functions, such as firewalling and intrusion detection. However, computing centrality is resource-demanding, we can not give for granted that it can be computed in real time at every change in the network topology. This is especially true in mesh networks that generally use devices with few computation resources. This paper shows that using the fastest state-of-the-art heuristic algorithm it is indeed possible to compute network centrality even in real, low-power networking hardware in a network made of up to 1000 nodes. Not only, observing the behavior of a real mesh network it shows that centrality does not need to be updated at every topology change, but it can be safely re-computed with an interval in the order of the tens of minutes. Our findings confirms that centrality can be effectively and successfully used as a building block for security functions in mesh networks.", "authors": ["Leonardo Maccari", "Quynh Nguyen", "Renato Lo Cigno"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["03a2eb6c-8a96-468e-b79f-282d069a4824", "063390a2-f032-473b-9806-db49733becdd", "1dc91e45-5985-4fd5-b62c-2b2df7c22b30", "22ea44eb-8d96-4bfc-aea4-94362672b98f", "28d2789b-7924-470a-9ec7-34363e00c975", "2c8e7e31-db3c-4207-8b28-ee8e2910dd87", "2ea644c7-5598-40fb-8afa-043ab2bfd529", "46adcb49-cb4d-4370-b0d2-50ec87f27cc9", "555fc5aa-69a3-473f-b7a3-2a2e69deb835", "631fa5b4-ccd0-4f8d-81dd-5b27fb10052b", "7b2e7ba1-1bb4-4d21-8120-fa84a27b6e84", "84d108d4-c2a5-4531-9dcf-39ede987bccf", "a2f6bc97-abdd-4f23-b2d1-7f57fab1429c", "b233c983-a938-4aeb-a375-d2900d101d24", "bb0cf3d2-3c83-465e-81df-c7f1bf7c7bd8", "befe08a2-967a-4846-a16a-db0f74d190c5", "c574452b-32e8-41e6-9c62-a9d3b05a5e6b", "c97e6efd-0469-4fcd-af6e-d9093fbb598f", "d49d8c12-a22d-41cb-bbed-3c03afd255eb", "ddcbdf0b-7da1-4ec0-80dd-be302a5fa8c3"], "title": "On the Computation of Centrality Metrics for Network Security in Mesh Networks", "venue": "global communications conference", "year": 2016, "id": "055c731d-eead-439a-bec4-f2028968cc31"}

In this paper, we derive formula of traffic delay for RC flows in TTEthernet with intensive TT-schedule schema under the condition of preemption transmission mode, expand performance analysis scope to support multi-priority flows through assuming TT flow as the highest-priority RC flow when considering the pessimism of scheduling and verify the practicability of modified model by calculating its algorithmic complexity.

{"abstract": "Wheeled ground robots are limited from exploring extreme environments such as caves, lava tubes and skylights. Small robots that can utilize unconventional mobility through hopping, flying or rolling can overcome these limitations. Mul-tiple robots operating as a team offer significant benefits over a single large ro-bot, as they are not prone to single-point failure, enable distributed command and control and enable execution of tasks in parallel. These robots can complement large rovers and landers, helping to explore inaccessible sites, obtaining samples and for planning future exploration missions. Our robots, the SphereX, are 3-kg in mass, spherical and contain computers equivalent to current smartphones. They contain an array of guidance, navigation and control sensors and electronics. SphereX contains room for a 1-kg science payload, including for sample return. Our work in this field has recognized the need for miniaturized chemical mobility systems that provide power and propulsion. Our research explored the use of miniature rockets, including solid rockets, bi-propellants including RP1/hydrogen-peroxide and polyurethane/ammonium-perchlorate. These propulsion options provide maximum flight times of 10 minutes on Mars. Flying, especially hovering consumes significant fuel; hence, we have been developing our robots to perform ballistic hops that enable the robots to travel efficiently over long distances. Techniques are being developed to enable mid-course correction during a ballistic hop. Using multiple cameras, it is possible to reconstitute an image scene from motion blur. Hence our approach is to enable photo mapping as the robots travel on a ballistic hop. The same images would also be used for navigation and path planning.

{"abstract": "Fundamental tradeoffs in green cellular networks with coexistence of machine-oriented and human-oriented traffic are investigated. First, we present a queuing system to model the uplink transmission of a green base station which serves two types of distinct traffic with strict requirements on delay and battery lifetime. Then, the energy-lifetime and energy-delay tradeoffs are introduced, and closed-form expressions for energy consumption of the base station, average experienced delay in data transmission, and expected battery lifetime of machine devices are derived. Furthermore, we extend the derived results to the multi-cell scenario, and investigate the impacts of system and traffic parameters on the energy-lifetime and energy-delay tradeoffs using analytical and numerical results.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present a distributed economic dispatch strategy for a large-scale power system. At first, we treat each generator and load in the grid as an \"agent\". By decomposing the centralized optimization into optimizations at local agents, a scheme is proposed for each agent to iteratively estimate a solution of the optimization problem in a distributed manner. Due to the large number of the agents, the agents are sorted into several clusters and each cluster has a leader to communicate with the leaders of its neighboring clusters. The agents in the same cluster can conduct local optimization and communicate with its neighboring agents in parallel. After that, the leader agents of each cluster exchange their information simultaneously. It is shown that the estimated solutions of all the agents reach consensus of the optimal solution asymptomatically. Compared to our previous work in [14], where the leader agent in each cluster conducts the optimization in a sequential way, the proposed scheme in this paper allows them communicate and conduct optimization simultaneously, which greatly improves the algorithm efficiency.

{"abstract": "Massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (M-MIMO) system is a promising technology that offers to mobile networks substantial increase in throughput. In Time-Division Duplexing (TDD), the uplink training allows a Base Station (BS) to acquire Channel State Information (CSI) for both uplink reception and downlink transmission. This is essential for M-MIMO systems where downlink training pilots would consume large portion of the bandwidth. In densely populated areas, pilot symbols are reused among neighboring cells. Pilot contamination is the fundamental bottleneck on the performance of M-MIMO systems. Pilot contamination effect in antenna arrays can be mitigated by treating the channel estimation problem in angular domain where channel sparsity can be exploited. In this paper, we introduce a codebook that projects the channel into orthogonal beams and apply Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) criterion to estimate the channel. We also propose data-aided channel covariance matrix estimation algorithm for angular domain MMSE channel estimator by exploiting properties of linear antenna array. The algorithm is based on simple linear operations and no matrix inversion is involved. Numerical results show that the algorithm performs well in mitigating pilot contamination where the desired channel and other interfering channels span overlapping angle-of-arrivals.", "authors": ["Yihenew Dagne Beyene", "Kalle Ruttik", "Riku J\u00e4ntti"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["397d220e-8154-4729-b2e4-10af297c6da4", "99d4c119-b99d-4931-a343-dc048cd562ca", "a4f35f32-3bec-43f9-9570-81f6d8aedfeb", "ad93a8cf-7157-4e38-8028-6acf2850e67a"], "title": "Angular Domain Data-Assisted Channel Estimation for Pilot Decontamination in Massive MIMO", "venue": "Mobile Information Systems", "year": 2017, "id": "08005b30-d0de-4578-84a3-dafa9b34c787"}

{"abstract": "This paper addresses the synchronization and state estimation problems for an array of coupled discrete-time stochastic complex networks (SCNs) with uncertain inner couplings in which time-varying delay is considered both in the network couplings and dynamical nodes. In particular, the uncertainties encountering in coupling terms are characterized by using the interval matrix approach. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional and utilizing Kronecker product properties, a new set of sufficient conditions is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee the synchronization of the addressed SCNs with a prescribed mixed  H  \u221e  and passivity performance index. Moreover, the state estimation problem is then studied for the same SCNs with uncertain inner coupling strength and subsequently, the estimator is designed. More precisely, Schur complement, discrete-time Jensen\u2019s inequality together with reciprocally convex combination approach are used to simplify the derivations in the main results. Finally, numerical examples are exploited to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization and state estimation results.", "authors": ["R. Sakthivel", "M. Sathishkumar", "B.

{"abstract": "Branch and bound is a well-known generic method for computing an optimal solution of a single-objective optimization problem. Based on the idea \u201cdivide to conquer\u201d, it consists in an implicit enumeration principle viewed as a tree search. Although the branch and bound was first suggested by Land and Doig (1960), the first complete algorithm introduced as a multi-objective branch and bound that we identified was proposed by Kiziltan and Yucaoglu (1983). Rather few multi-objective branch and bound algorithms have been proposed. This situation is not surprising as the contributions on the extensions of the components of branch and bound for multi-objective optimization are recent. For example, the concept of bound sets, which extends the classic notion of bounds, has been mentioned by Villarreal and Karwan (1981).

{"abstract": "Self-reconfigurable modular robots (SRMRs) have recently attracted considerable attention because of their numerous potential applications in the real world. In this paper, we draw a comprehensive comparison among five different algorithms in path planning of a novel SRMR system called ACMoD through an environment comprised of various terrains in a static condition. The contribution of this work is that the reconfiguration ability of ACMoD has been taken into account. This consideration, though raises new algorithmic challenges, equips the robot with new capability to pass difficult terrains rather than bypassing them, and consequently the robot can achieve better performance in terms of traversal time and energy consumption. In this work, four different optimization algorithms, including Adaptive Genetic Algorithm, Elitist Ant System, Dijkstra and Dynamic Weighting A*, along with a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm called Q-Learning, are proposed to solve this path planning problem. The outputs of these algorithms are the optimal path through the environment and the associated configuration on each segment of the path. The challenges involved in mapping the path planning problem to each algorithm are discussed in full details.

In this paper, we first conduct a detailed analysis on an HTM-based concurrent B+Tree, which uncovers several reasons for excessive HTM aborts induced by both false and true conflicts under contention. Based on the analysis, we advocate Eunomia, a design pattern for search trees which contains several principles to reduce HTM aborts, including splitting HTM regions with version-based concurrency control to reduce HTM working sets, partitioned data layout to reduce false conflicts, proactively detecting and avoiding true conflicts, and adaptive concurrency control. To validate their effectiveness, we apply such designs to construct a scalable concurrent B+Tree using HTM.

In this paper, we propose a unified adaptive transmission scheme - adaptive spatial modulation that allocates information into signal space and spatial dimension in order to maximize the overall channel capacity for single RF chain MIMO. The proposed adaptive spatial modulation is realized by using Huffman coding, i.e., designing variable length codes to activate the transmit antenna with different probabilities. The optimal antenna activation probability is derived through optimizing channel capacity. To make the optimization tractable, closed form upper bound and lower bound are derived as the effective approximations for channel capacity. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive spatial modulation offers considerable performance improvement over both spatial modulation and transmit antenna selection.", "authors": ["Wei Wang", "Wei Zhang"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["19392837-7972-4aa7-a860-d6c90458f7b8", "4f48b371-d692-4a79-ad46-a9159dfdd672", "748a2ab3-8b5f-4d0a-9e2d-af685089843a", "870d11c0-8636-4f9a-b265-1016474bebff", "b4022bac-a157-4a3a-9cab-050b7c5a49c3", "c9c5a9c0-f1b7-4286-8538-13476ae32e60"], "title": "Adaptive Spatial Modulation Using Huffman Coding", "venue": "global communications conference", "year": 2016, "id": "0a13520f-b058-43ff-ad3b-5e292422887e"}
{"abstract": "Semantic image segmentation is a fundamental task in image understanding. Per-pixel semantic labelling of an image benefits greatly from the ability to consider region consistency both locally and globally. However, many Fully Convolutional Network based methods do not impose such consistency, which may give rise to noisy and implausible predictions. We address this issue by proposing a dense multi-label network module that is able to encourage the region consistency at different levels. This simple but effective module can be easily integrated into any semantic segmentation systems. With comprehensive experiments, we show that the dense multi-label can successfully remove the implausible labels and clear the confusion so as to boost the performance of semantic segmentation systems.", "authors": ["Tong Shen", "Guosheng Lin", "Chunhua Shen", "Ian D.

{"abstract": "This paper investigates a new analog beamforming architecture for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where each of the multiple transmit antennas is switched to be on or off to form a beam according to the channel state information at transmitters. This on-off analog beamforming (OABF) scheme has the advantages in terms of both hardware complexities and algorithmic complexities. OABF can completely remove the high-cost, power-consuming and bulky analog phase-shifters that are extensively employed by traditional analog beamforming schemes; it only requires the deployment of low-cost analog switches that are easy to implement. Moreover, we show that the beams formed by such simple antenna on-off switch operations can achieve rather good performances with low-complexity beamforming algorithms. Specifically, we first propose two optimal signal-to-noise ratio maximization algorithms to determine the on-off state of each switch under the per-antenna power constraint and the total power constraint, respectively. After that, we theoretically prove that OABF can achieve the full diversity gain and the full array gain with complexities up to a polynomial order. Numerical results are consistent with our theoretical analysis. We believe that the simple structure of OABF makes massive MIMO much easier to implement in real systems.", "authors": ["Shengli Zhang", "Chongtao Guo", "Taotao Wang", "Wei Zhang"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["13325197-396a-4b84-9ee4-f3a193af131d", "147cc7ee-cf84-4cf9-b2a0-ab2da2912ac8", "1b934bda-fb88-4f6d-8032-160bdeb680ff", "1c51be67-2491-4df6-95e1-c9403b173a6b", "1edb2abc-4a7e-4578-849b-b055cd65f21f", "277c3c6a-d523-4943-b4d1-93dae21252a1", "369c3d88-a460-49e5-9900-f3df356350e6", "4f1448d5-3f22-4ad2-b0c4-1cb66ddea741", "5db1f8dd-aeb0-42fd-8ce1-d86ccfe51332", "6b4920a9-9dbd-411e-9618-0dd545bc97d7", "6b96ace2-e362-4610-941c-37b19dc90b61", "6de05dcb-2e39-46d2-bf91-d7bd8f59ca21", "8d9b92a6-65ba-41bc-8525-2671ef222ad5", "96c5991e-38e8-4e72-a8e8-cec692040cca", "99d4c119-b99d-4931-a343-dc048cd562ca", "a686f64c-5d93-4644-9594-c4f02168179e", "aac78168-869e-4d80-950e-5c08e9f66e2e", "ab59fc80-35fc-4ed5-a12c-3f0a6f69eadd", "ae7acb26-9841-4ca8-89bd-868192245a35", "d2b797a2-ddbf-4e65-b545-ceb09b4a6d1e", "d863de8c-c7e1-4a4e-9f6b-59b21a10c5e6", "ddc5fdfa-2ad9-4801-ae5f-b778ec5fa5f4", "e769e232-fb20-4da9-a77a-4bf916c5f756", "f17f15fa-73b2-42d9-a95f-59e5fa95918b"], "title": "On-off Analog Beamforming for Massive MIMO", "venue": "arXiv: Information Theory", "year": 2017, "id": "0b65cc36-16e3-4c8b-9e86-c49cb982e4bf"}
{"abstract": "Structured regression has been successfully used in many applications where explanatory and response variables are inter-correlated, such as in weighted attributed networks. One of structured models, Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRF), utilizing multiple unstructured models to learn the non-linear relationships between node attributes and the structured response variable, achieves high prediction accuracy. However, it does not scale well with large networks. We propose a novel model, called Scalable Approximate GCRF (SA-GCRF), which integrates weighted attributed network compression with GCRF, with the aim of making GCRF applicable to large networks. The model consists of three steps: first, it compresses a network into a smaller one by generalizing nodes into supernodes and edges into superedges; then, it applies GCRF to the reduced network; and finally, it unfolds the predicted response variables into the original nodes. Our hypothesis is that the reduced network maintains most information of the original network such that the loss in prediction accuracy obtained by GCRF on the reduced network is minor. The comprehensive experimental results indicate that SA-GCRF was 150\u2013520 times faster than standard GCRF and 11\u201329 times faster than state-of-the-art UmGCRF on large networks, and provided regression results where GCRF and UmGCRF were not applicable.

{"abstract": "It is becoming increasingly achievable for steel bridge structures, which are normally both inaccessible and hazardous for humans, to be inspected and maintained by autonomous robots. Steel bridges have been traditionally constructed by securing plate members together with rivets. However, rivets present a challenge for robots both in terms of cleaning and surface traversal. This paper presents a novel approach to RGB-D image and point cloud analysis that enables rivets to be rapidly and robustly located using low cost, non-contact sensing devices that can be easily affixed to a robot. The approach performs classification based on: (a) high-intensity blobs in color images, (b) the non-linear perturbations in depth images, and (c) surface normal clusters in 3D point clouds. The predicted rivet locations from the three classifiers are combined using a probabilistic occupancy mapping technique.

{"abstract": "A fundamental problem in a pure Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing system is how to protect the anonymity of nodes when providing efficient data access services. By seamlessly combining the technologies of multi-proxy and IP multicast together, we propose a multicast-based protocol for efficient file sharing with mutual anonymity in this paper. Furthermore, the proposed protocol can adaptively adjust file distribution and reduce the multicast cost simultaneously.

{"abstract": "The purposes of this study are mainly to investigate the relationships among website features (i.e. utilitarian and hedonic features), user experience, perceived value (i.e. information value, experiential value, social value, and transaction value), user attitude, and behavioral intentions (i.e. intention to use and word-of-mouth intention), and additionally the mediating effects of user experience and attitude are also explored in this study in an online gamification context. Specifically, this study applies a structural equation model to test the causal relationships among those website features, user experience, perceived value, user experience, and behavioral intentions in an online gamification context. Results show that both utilitarian features and hedonic features have significant impact on users\u2019 experience, which in turn affects their perception of value and attitude. Users\u2019 perceptions of information and transaction value also significantly affect their attitude, and in turn affect their behavioral intentions. Besides, the mediating effects of user experience and attitude are also confirmed in this study. To summarize, the findings of this study can help website managers improve their users\u2019 perceptions of value and attitude more effectively and act as a guide for research and development (R&D) of gamification to acquire competitive advantage and further evoke desired behavioral intentions.", "authors": ["Chia-Lin Hsu", "Yen-Chun Chen", "Tai-Ning Yang", "Wei-Ko Lin"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["2df731d1-37e4-4afb-a9b0-60a5361a79ff", "3b7b755c-b7a6-4bf6-a1de-3eed75e50eff", "460b56a6-d9ff-4e34-960d-0f0805262b88", "54911c29-ab00-46c6-883e-4df97c0df1c1", "659657d9-66a6-4759-bf0e-1235b60758bb", "679148a5-48e3-4daf-9ef6-31d4a08bf330", "6b5c8aae-782f-4ed3-949b-a150486924e5", "74014aad-6165-4500-a9f5-65c7d4516be0", "75c5360b-18ad-4dd6-ab43-229d4b02bb3d", "79afb9f0-5a7b-47b6-952b-4e18bdd1674a", "866c2a31-34a7-444c-bc9b-5d97c085c25a", "95f17033-1fa7-40e2-91a1-20f70140dfc2", "9920dd78-68d6-4a27-8047-84cc96acf70a", "ad34ea29-5a2d-47d2-83f4-7e61fe42e5d4", "ae0af874-6edb-4345-86f0-bd86c058522b", "b584d0f7-d152-47a5-9825-d303afe88742", "bbc5067e-2e87-4fe2-9b4d-a0831234e044", "bf0a2af5-197c-4585-a63b-14c166417de6", "cf4fc727-58ec-40d9-aaa9-5aae209d634c", "e4fe8ca2-d490-46d0-8aef-1ccaa3f373fa", "e77af969-ba5f-4337-859f-3ee09dee6e51", "efdae899-db16-40b8-965d-9aebbd3eab80", "f5dd0c95-72d3-4c72-9eeb-f8fbcf3434df", "f7b13770-5076-4eb9-9725-ea1465cd4da9"], "title": "Do website features matter in an online gamification context?

Moreover, in the high-resolution flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the encoder structure will be simpler compared to conventional ones. As the simplest type, the two-segment encoder is used in this paper. By assistance of some MCML multiplexers, each segment encodes the most significant bits (MSBs) and the least significant bits (LSBs) separately.

{"abstract": "Processed genes are functional genes that have arisen as a result of the retrotransposition of mRNA molecules. We found 6 genes that generated processed genes in the common ancestor of five Brassicaceae species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata, Capsella rubella, Brassica rapa and Thellungiella parvula). These processed genes have therefore been kept for at least 30\u00a0million\u00a0years. Analyses of the Ka/Ks ratio of these genes, and of those having given rise to them, show that they evolve relatively slowly and suggest that the processed genes maintained the same function as that of their parental gene. There is a significant negative correlation between the number of ESTs and transcripts produced and the Ka/Ks ratios of the parental genes but not of the processed genes. This suggests that selection has not yet adapted the selective pressure the processed genes experience to their expression level. However, the A. thaliana processed genes tend to be expressed in the same tissues as that of their parental genes. Furthermore, most have a CAATT-box, a TATA-box and are located about 1\u00a0kb from another protein-coding gene. Altogether, our results suggest that the processed genes found in the A. thaliana genome have been kept to produce more of the same product, and in the same tissues, as that encoded by their parental gene.", "authors": ["Basma T.M.

{"abstract": "Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a well-established and well-understood technique, widely used for dependability evaluation of a wide range of systems. Although many extensions of fault trees have been proposed, they suffer from a variety of shortcomings. In particular, even where software tool support exists, these analyses require a lot of manual effort. Over the past two decades, research has focused on simplifying dependability analysis by looking at how we can synthesise dependability information from system models automatically. This has led to the field of model-based dependability analysis (MBDA). Different tools and techniques have been developed as part of MBDA to automate the generation of dependability analysis artefacts such as fault trees. Firstly, this paper reviews the standard fault tree with its limitations. Secondly, different extensions of standard fault trees are reviewed. Thirdly, this paper reviews a number of prominent MBDA techniques where fault trees are used as a means for system dependability analysis and provides an insight into their working mechanism, applicability, strengths and challenges.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we focus on online representation learning in non-stationary environments which may require continuous adaptation of model architecture. We propose a novel online dictionary-learning (sparse-coding) framework which incorporates the addition and deletion of hidden units (dictionary elements), and is inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, known to be associated with improved cognitive function and adaptation to new environments. In the online learning setting, where new input instances arrive sequentially in batches, the neuronal-birth is implemented by adding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); the number of new units is determined by the current performance (representation error) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate. Neuronal-death is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity) on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at each iteration of our online alternating minimization scheme, which iterates between the code and dictionary updates. Finally, hidden unit connectivity adaptation is facilitated by introducing sparsity in dictionary elements. Our empirical evaluation on several real-life datasets (images and language) as well as on synthetic data demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably outperform the state-of-art fixed-size (nonadaptive) online sparse coding of Mairal et al. (2009) in the presence of nonstationary data. Moreover, we identify certain properties of the data (e.g., sparse inputs with nearly non-overlapping supports) and of the model (e.g., dictionary sparsity) associated with such improvements.", "authors": ["Sahil Garg", "Irina Rish", "Guillermo A.

{"abstract": "The existing methods for texture modeling include co-occurrence statistics, filter banks and random fields. However most of these methods lack of capability to characterize the different scale of texture effectively. In this paper, we propose a texture representation which combines local scale feature, amplitude and phase of wavelet modules in multi-scales. The self-similarity of texture is not globally uniform and could be measured in both correlations across the multi-scale and statistical feature within a single-scale. In our approach, the local scale feature is represented by optimal scale obtained through the evolution of wavelet modulus across multi-scales. Then, for all the blocks of the same optimal scale, the statistical measurement of amplitude is extracted to represent the energy within the corresponding frequency band; the statistical measurement of the phase of modulus is extracted to represent the texture's orientation. Our experiment indicates that, in the proposed texture representation the separability of different texture patterns is larger than the one of the traditional features.", "authors": ["Sheng Yi", "Hanqiang Cao", "Xutao Li", "Miao Liu"], "n_citation": 0, "title": "A new texture representation with multi-scale wavelet feature.", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "id": "0e5ba392-571f-4e50-a0be-6e4b208fdb63"}

We show that the gap between the DoF upper bound and an achievable DoF is small for some typical scenarios. Moreover, we quantify the DoF gain due to caching with respect to some important system parameters.

While several artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms are addressed for gait analysis, they usually utilize supervised techniques where subject groups are defined a priori. In this paper, we explore to investigate gait pattern mining with clustering-based approaches, in which k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms are employed to derive gait pattern. After feature selection and data preparation, we conduct clustering on the constructed gait data model to build up pattern-based clusters. The centroids of clusters are then treated as the subject profiles to model the various kinds of gait pattern, e.g. normal or pathological. Experiments are undertaken to visualize the derived subject clusters, evaluate the quality of clustering paradigm in terms of silhouette and mean square error and compare the results with the discovery derived from hierarchy tree analysis.

{"abstract": "Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a new non-orthogonal multiple-access technique in future wireless networks. In SCMA uplink burst transmission, user detection and channel estimation require significant pilot overhead. Dispersive channels with relative small coherent frequency / time, as well as fading diversity techniques, both lead to a result that multiple fading blocks are taken during one transmission. In this paper, a new method of separating SCMA user detection and channel estimation among different fading blocks in dispersive channels is proposed to reduce pilot overhead. Further more, according to the sparsity of SCMA codebooks, a new mapping pattern from SCMA layers to physical resources is proposed to improve channel estimation performance with given pilots.

{"abstract": "In conventional cognitive radio ad hoc networks, both primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) are typically equipped with omni-directional antennas, which can cause high interference. As a result, SUs usually suffer from the poor network connectivity due to the high interference caused by PUs. Different from omni-directional antennas, directional antennas can concentrate the transmission on some desired directions and reduce interference on other undesired directions. In this paper, we investigate the network connectivity of a novel cognitive radio ad hoc network with directional antennas (DIR-CRAHNs), in which both PUs and SUs are equipped with directional antennas.

This heterogeneous cloud manages these devices with the use of OpenStack. We observe that our infrastructure is limited due to the physical infrastructure such as the 1~Gb Ethernet connection. Our framework however can be ported to other physical infrastructures. We tested our infrastructure with a database acceleration application. This application was replicated six times across three FPGAs within our cluster and we observed a throughput increase of six times as this scaled linearly. Our framework generates the OpenStack calls needed to reserve the compute devices, creates the network connections (and retrieve MAC addresses), generate the bitstreams, programs the devices, and configure the devices with the appropriate MAC addresses, creating a ready-to-use network device that can interact with any other network device in the data center.", "authors": ["Naif Tarafdar", "Thomas Lin", "Eric Fukuda", "Hadi Bannazadeh", "Alberto Leon-Garcia", "Paul Chow"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["206329f4-ce86-4dfb-99fe-cf6f6d406761", "5f6fffac-894a-407e-97c0-0dbd64b596a4", "9b2538f1-6445-4916-9055-654c8d1691f3", "ba6b59e3-0bc3-4c22-81ee-899a4a1a9552", "c21a45c4-2215-48f1-9012-05b154d2e5d2"], "title": "Enabling Flexible Network FPGA Clusters in a Heterogeneous Cloud Data Center", "venue": "field programmable gate arrays", "year": 2017, "id": "0fea982c-3e4b-48eb-ae67-9641d3fe266b"}
{"abstract": "Speech perception and comprehension are often challenged by the need to recognize speech sounds that are degraded or ambiguous. Here, we explore the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved in resolving ambiguity in the identity of speech sounds using syllables that contain ambiguous phonetic segments (e.g., intermediate sounds between /b/ and /g/ as in \u201cblade\u201d and \u201cglade\u201d). We used an audio-morphing procedure to create a large set of natural sounding minimal pairs that contain phonetically ambiguous onset or offset consonants (differing in place, manner, or voicing). These ambiguous segments occurred in different lexical contexts (i.e., in words or pseudowords, such as blade\u2013glade or blem\u2013glem) and in different phonological environments (i.e., with neighboring syllables that differed in lexical status, such as blouse\u2013glouse). These stimuli allowed us to explore the impact of phonetic ambiguity on the speed and accuracy of lexical decision responses (Experiment 1), semantic categorization responses (Exper...", "authors": ["Jack Rogers", "Matthew H.

{"abstract": "The continuous evolution of Next Generation Internet (NGI) amplifies the demand for efficient and secure communication capable of responding effectively to the challenges posed by the emerging applications. For secure communication between two sensor nodes, a secret key is needed. Cryptographic key management is a challenging task in sensor networks as the hostile environment of sensor networks makes it more prone to attacks. Apart from resource constraints of the devices, unknown topology of the network, the higher risk of node capture and lack of a fixed infrastructure makes the key management more challenging in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Paper surveys different key Management schemes for WSN. The paper presents the efficiency versus security requirements tradeoffs in key management for WSN. Paper also proposes a novel key management protocol which provides strong resistance against replay attacks. The results obtained from the mathematical model based on conditional probability of the scheme suggest that the proposed key management in NGI is efficient and attack resistant.", "authors": ["Vinod V.

{"abstract": "Data analytics frameworks shift towards larger degrees of parallelism. Efficient scheduling of data-parallel jobs (tasks) is critical for improving job performance such as response time, and resource utilization. It is an important challenge for large scale data analytics frameworks in which jobs are more complex and have diverse characteristics (e.g., diverse resource requirements). Prior work on scheduling cannot achieve low response time and high resource utilization simultaneously because they cannot accurately estimate the durations of tasks in the queue of a worker machine by using sampling-based approach (including sampling with late binding) for task placement, and thus they fail to place tasks at the best possible worker machine. Also, they do not sufficiently consider the diverse resource requirements of jobs (tasks) for placing tasks on worker machines. To address this challenge, we propose a Dependency-aware and Resource-efficient Scheduling (DRS) to achieve low response time and high resource utilization. DRS takes into account task dependency and assigns tasks that are independent of each other to different worker machines. Also, DRS considers tasks' resource requirements and packs complementary tasks whose resource demands on multiple resources are complementary to each other to increase the resource utilization. In addition, DRS uses the mutual reinforcement learning to estimate the task's waiting time (the duration of tasks in the queue of a worker), and assigns tasks to workers with the consideration of tasks' waiting time to reduce the response time. Extensive experimental results based on a real cluster and experiments using real-world Amazon EC2 cloud service show that DRS achieves low response time and high resource utilization compared to previous strategies.", "authors": ["Jinwei Liu", "Haiying Shen"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["004b7183-1fb5-4e08-b29a-87c679316171", "0150e049-f8af-4658-9234-692f0471eadd", "01c92637-18cc-4d81-8a61-8c53e14ec3ec", "05ec9566-0998-4bba-9caf-c7a003ca1143", "05f80cf9-60af-4ee7-b1a1-7fe27ef6aeb2", "12b33ad1-126b-481e-b3e8-9136975af65b", "1428ce54-e998-4798-9c4e-e7c3261c46e3", "183b304d-3dbd-4f4f-840c-2f2e2f45192b", "1973143d-036f-434b-8570-4acb3308369c", "1df7e734-702f-4adc-9d4b-f24e7ff28506", "1e78f2d9-f6d5-4e0d-9cbc-a2ebfe9bf315", "240293ef-c638-42fc-84f0-adfcb0154303", "33b89c99-821c-450a-9580-948e7bbde37e", "360adff5-5029-4992-8e6b-b921720864e5", "4a68ca5d-9a2f-48f9-a78e-391c832be405", "59af7e25-c0ee-4af5-acea-a58dfe4ccac4", "5be721f1-db7e-4a6f-a4f5-9e58a3779883", "5c6c859b-47d7-4095-80d2-cdd91a65be75", "72b43f43-1284-485a-8b0c-89a167a6ba7a", "7e3704a4-f84d-4a26-bbf4-67afd2981209", "7ebfbf9d-bef3-4e63-b427-b2f628d37a8f", "9558f1d8-969d-41b4-bcff-d1d0faa61595", "95cb467a-4887-4b11-8e8a-4d14a3acefc4", "9d8465b5-c7bb-4080-be81-385d265030cd", "9f5c18e7-6253-444f-b14a-08575dad708c", "a264226c-b575-4612-9c16-e898de4a0153", "a845e3d3-fd79-47c4-8af4-1d42c3d28390", "b2cd814e-38cb-49a5-86bf-012fe8b4ad26", "b799e57f-99c8-4d6e-b791-8b146bd68c57", "ba73da26-2ff7-4936-9aa8-ae5329ea3c01", "bd9d86a7-c62c-48e4-8ead-49f30c6e889d", "c386124a-ef27-4d52-a323-4941c0277f2a", "c8fa91fc-6264-4fcc-b30f-e1fb1d3bbc00", "d8a4e5b7-2ddf-45c8-8b97-9f72c261eba1", "db5df514-3619-4205-9bde-91875602d716", "f097efb0-b696-4513-82d1-a4dfe881424e", "fa9608b8-d238-462a-a2cf-76182ff7014b", "fbc9491f-ec77-4472-9faf-f6d2f81fc45e", "fcc8fc14-fc6b-46d0-9104-2272f916bddd"], "title": "Dependency-Aware and Resource-Efficient Scheduling for Heterogeneous Jobs in Clouds", "venue": "ieee international conference on cloud computing technology and science", "year": 2016, "id": "11997fa1-0571-413a-bacd-4ae3162353dd"}

{"abstract": "This work presents a new low-loss active inductor whose self-resonance frequency and quality factor parameters can be adjusted independently from each other. In order to achieve this property, a new input topology has been employed which consists of cascode structure with a diode connected transistor. Furthermore, the proposed input topology makes the device robust in terms of its performance over variation in process, voltage and temperature. Additionally, RC feedback is used to cancel series-loss resistance of the active inductor, which allows self-resonant enhancement as well. Schematic and post-layout simulation results show the theoretical validity of the design. To validate the design feasibility for process, voltage and temperature changes, Monte Carlo and temperature analysis are done. Suggested structure shows inductor behavior in the frequency range of 0.3\u201311.3\u00a0GHz. Maximum quality factor is obtained as high as 2.1k at 5.9\u00a0GHz.

{"abstract": "Advanced personalized web applications require a carefully dealing with their users' wishes and preferences. Since such preferences do not always hold in general, personalized applications also have to consider the user's current situation. In this paper we present a novel framework for modeling situations and situated preferences. Our approach consists of a general meta model for situations, which can be applied as foundation for situation models in a wide range of applications. Furthermore, an XML-based preference repository for the storage and management of situated preferences is developed. Long-term and situated preferences can easily be accessed with the preference repository interface. Particularly, preferences best-matching to a given situation can be queried. This approach allows web applications to react flexibly and personalized to the changing situations of their users.", "authors": ["Stefan Holland", "W.

{"abstract": "In this paper a tool based on the g m /I D -methodology is presented to provide information on operating point-dependent degradation in integrated circuits caused by NBTI and HCI during early design stages. The advantage of the presented GMID-Tool is that it does not require any further SPICE or aging simulations after the extraction of the fest and aged small signal parameters of a single transistor. Using the GMID-Tool, the design time of an integrated circuit is reduced significantly. In addition, the GMID-Tool is process-independent and universally applicable as it takes technology specific data as input. The verification of the GMID-Tool is shown at the example of a Common-Source Amplifier and a Miller-OTA.", "authors": ["Theodor Hillebrand", "Timur Sch\u00e4fer", "Nico Hellwege", "Marco Erstling", "Dagmar Peters-Drolshagen", "Steffen Paul"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["0f9955dd-81bb-4b96-a938-b7769a8d12a9", "115715e0-3059-4d05-8970-a175a7ef81a7"], "title": "Design and verification of analog CMOS circuits using the g m /I D -method with age-dependent degradation effects", "venue": "power and timing modeling optimization and simulation", "year": 2016, "id": "14af3736-2484-4432-841a-cd8960481b58"}

{"abstract": "This paper studies how to adjoin probability to event structures, leading to the model of probabilistic event structures. In their simplest form probabilistic choice is localised to cells, where conflict arises; in which case probabilistic independence coincides with causal independence. An application to the semantics of a probabilistic CCS is sketched. An event structure is associated with a domain-that of its configurations ordered by inclusion. In domain theory probabilistic processes are denoted by continuous valuations on a domain. A key result of this paper is a representation theorem showing how continuous valuations on the domain of a confusion-free event structure correspond to the probabilistic event structures it supports. We explore how to extend probability to event structures which are not confusion-free via two notions of probabilistic runs of a general event structure. Finally, we show how probabilistic correlation and probabilistic event structures with confusion can arise from event structures which are originally confusion-free by using morphisms to rename and hide events.", "authors": ["Daniele Varacca", "Hagen V\u00f6lzer", "Glynn Winskel"], "n_citation": 50, "title": "Probabilistic event structures and domains", "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "year": 2004, "id": "14c7fdc4-4c54-4424-96fd-bac291f034fd"}
{"abstract": "Low sidelobes are important and essential in all SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images, regardless of the imaging mode, for fewer artificial targets. For strip-map mode all targets overlap in frequency, which is convenient to suppress sidelobes. However, weighting requires total overlap in the time or frequency domain, which a sliding spotlight signal could not satisfy. Furthermore, the wavelength cannot be regarded as a constant value under the condition of a wideband chirp signal, which leads to the variation of the Doppler bandwidth along with the range frequency. In this article, an azimuth weighting method is proposed that considers the influence of a wideband based on a two-step algorithm. The computer simulation is given to verify the presented method.", "authors": ["Feng Xiao", "Zegang Ding", "Bin Xiong Bin Xiong", "Teng Long"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["518a693f-c4ac-4b30-a76b-94ea9a186d34", "5d615d8b-fbfc-495c-8dd5-9396e8bb580d", "6461f523-2e48-4621-a97c-4243f48662dc", "8daaabef-18be-4815-9beb-442a3ecbd162", "8f5a807a-0614-4559-ae7f-3a99bdaef0ff", "9156a841-4e2b-4cd4-ae49-5f8107db8618", "9985cd10-82ff-4236-8cdf-897170c87ce2", "cf276c9d-c0a5-4200-b3b7-0e10e4429d96", "daf93e32-089a-450b-b2c0-8fc9348e463c", "dcc45570-5f72-48ce-9623-2c878da28925"], "title": "A Modified Azimuth Weighting Method in a Two-Step Process Approach for Sliding Spotlight Data Processing", "venue": "Sensors", "year": 2017, "id": "158a44ed-7619-4764-a545-7257f7e96643"}
